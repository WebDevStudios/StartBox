Download
------------
Download here: [startbox.zip](http://wpstartbox.com/startbox.zip)

Installation
------------
StartBox can be installed like any other WordPress theme, either via the built-in Theme Uploader, or by manually uploading to your server it via (s)FTP.

*Important:* If you use the "Repository Download" button, github will generate a file named "StartBox-master"). It is important that you rename the unzipped theme directory to "startbox", otherwise your child theme won't recognize that StartBox has been installed.

Usage
------------
We highly recommend that you use a Child Theme instead of running StartBox directly. We've created a pretty simple [StartBox Child Theme](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/StartBox-Child) for you to modify and destroy as you see fit.

If you're looking for a more high-caliber design, we recommend one of these [excellent themes](http://wpstartbox.com/themes/).
